# Gassans Portfolio



## Description

This webpage shows my personal portfolio and provides information about me, my work, my resume, and how to contact me. At the moment I dont have work to show so I have used placeholder links that will direct you to my GitHub profile. I plan on updating this and fixing it to show the most current work and information about myself and how to contact me. I created this portfolio webpage in order to show potential employers my skills (or lack there of) in HTML and CSS coding.
